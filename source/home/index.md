## **Nashville Small Business IT**

As a Nashville based computer service, Finding Apogee takes pride in the fact that half our customers are return or referred customers. Our unique business model of providing quality computer repair at an affordable price means a new customer is a customer for life.  We've heard the stories about how our competitors have charged very high prices with a low level of satisfaction and have learned from it.  At Finding Apogee, we believe that every customer deserves an honest consultation about how to approach their computer issue. Remember, at Finding Apogee, a consultation is ALWAYS free.
