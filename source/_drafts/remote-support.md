There are two ways for our Finding Apogee technicians to establish a connection with your computer. One very simple, the other requiring a little more configuration.

### Easy solution:

1.  TemporarilyÂ disable any antivirus (Our one click solution installs itself. Many virus protectors see that as a threat).
2.  [Download](http://findingapogee.com/p/FindingApogeeSupport.exe "Download") our one-click support software from: [http://findingapogee.com/p/FindingApogeeSupport.exe](http://findingapogee.com/p/FindingApogeeSupport.exe "http://findingapogee.com/p/FindingApogeeSupport.exe")
3.  Double-click on FindingApogeeSupport.exe
4.  The software is now installed!

### Advanced solution:

1.  Download and install [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome?brand=CHMO#eula "Google Chrome")
2.  Install the [Remote Desktop BETA](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp) Chrome extension
3.  Allow access, and click the green "Share" button
4.  Give the twelve digit access number to your Finding Apogee technician
